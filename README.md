# Streamlit GUI

Choose a few test images from the DOTA V1 dataset for the GUI demo. The object detection results on these images highlight the improvements achieved by using SRGAN for super-resolution compared to low-resolution inputs. 
We observe that there is an improvement in the average confidence scores of OBB detections and there is an increase in the total number of small objects detected on Super resolved images.
